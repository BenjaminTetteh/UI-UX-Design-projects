## Ceremony Planning Mobile App 
The Bliss Wedding Planning app will assist and guide recently engaged couples who lack experience in planning their wedding ceremonies. 
The app will accomplish this by providing guidance and prompting users to perform scheduled tasks, guest planning, tracking payments/budgets, and vendor management.
I was the UX designer for this project from conception to delivery. My responsibilities were conducting interviews, paper and digital wireframing, low and high-fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies, accounting for accessibility, and iterating on designs.
